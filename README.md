# qr-code

-Overview
This is the first challenge I did from Frontend Mentor, a
"QR code". This project is done only using html and css,
Especially using flexbox.
Frontend Mentor provided all assests to do the project.

-What I learned
Learned a bit more about flexbox and how overflows affect
the container divs. Overflow is something new I learned 
doing this project. Also learned that inorder to contain 
a image in a container width:100% should be given to the
img element.
